Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This course is Jerry Zhu's intro to artificial intelligence in UW-Madison.
This class is very interesting if you wanted do machine learning for you future job.
However it touches on multiple concepts while only maintaning introductory depth.
Exams are irrelevant from what you learn in lecture, also they require you to memorize
formulas and their intermediate results. 

But I would recomment this class to you, because you can still learn a lot from the class
even you did not do well on the exams, especially if you like AI.
